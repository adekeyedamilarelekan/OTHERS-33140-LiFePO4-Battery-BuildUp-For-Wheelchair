# OTHERS-33140-LiFePO4-Battery-BuildUp-For-Wheelchair
In this project, I demonstrate how to build a powerful and efficient 24V LiFePO4 battery pack, ideal for powering electric wheelchairs or other 24V devices.

This comprehensive guide walks you through every step, including:

- Selecting the right components.
- Assembling the battery pack with a JBD 8S BMS for protection.
- Integrating active and passive balancers for optimal performance.
- Wiring and soldering with durable copper cables.
- Upgrading to robust XT-60 connectors for secure and reliable connections.
- Installing a charge and voltage display for real-time monitoring.
  
Whether you're passionate about DIY battery projects or curious about LiFePO4 technology, this tutorial provides valuable insights into creating a safe, efficient, and long-lasting battery pack.
